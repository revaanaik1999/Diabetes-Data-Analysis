# Diabetes Patient Readmission Prediction
This repository contains the Patient Readmission Prediction project, which aims to improve patient outcomes in hospitals 
by predicting patient readmission using machine learning algorithms. The project analyzes electronic health records from 130 US hospitals over a decade, covering data from over 100,000 patients.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days after discharge. 
By using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, the project offers a predictive solution that can help hospitals reduce readmission rates and improve patient care. 

The models achieved promising results:
* F1-score: 73%
* Precision: 80%
* Recall: 69%

# The project pipeline includes 
  - data cleaning
  - data preprocessing
  - feature engineering 
  - model training

# Dataset
* Source: The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains electronic health records from 130 US hospitals.
* Size: Over 100,000 patient records.
* Duration: 10 years.
